# jenkins

This is a jenkins Docker image with Docker installed to run jenkins job via docker.

This will enable to define your build environment in a docker file and you dont have to worry about installing build software like Jdk etc on your build slave.
Also it will enable you to use real database server rather then in memory database to do integration tests.
